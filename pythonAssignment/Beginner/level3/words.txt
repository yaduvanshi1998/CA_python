Jasper was a joyful journalist who loved jumping over jagged rocks in the jungle. 
He jotted notes in his journal with jittery hands whenever he spotted a jaguar or 
heard a jackal’s howl. Just last January, Jasper journeyed through the dense 
jungles of Jamaica, jotting down every jingle and jabber he encountered. 

The jungle, with its juicy fruits and jumbled paths, was a jackpot of joy for 
Jasper. He often joked about joining a jungle expedition with his friend Jamie, 
who juggled jobs just to fund his jet-setting dreams. Jasper’s jacket was always 
jammed with jellybeans, which he generously shared with jubilant children he met 
during his jaunts.

Though his journey was jarring at times, Jasper never lost his jovial spirit. 
Journalism, he believed, was not just a job — it was a journey through stories 
and truth.
